This C11 translation is based on the SLICOT-Reference library and maintains
the same BSD 3-Clause License. All algorithmic content, documentation, and
test cases are derived from the original SLICOT Fortran77 source code.

The translation preserves:
- Original algorithm implementations
- Column-major array storage (Fortran-compatible)
- Function signatures and parameter semantics
- Numerical accuracy and stability
